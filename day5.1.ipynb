      "I sometimes have to pinch myself. I’m incredibly lucky to be working in the field of AI at a time when it’s rewriting the boundaries of human and tech possibilities. I’m personally most drawn to applying AI to real world problems, and the specific problem of hiring has plagued me throughout my career. So I’m in the business of finding people their dream jobs — and conveniently, I’m in my dream job myself.\n",

      "After a 20 year career in Financial Services, the most rewarding thing to me about untapt was that we were tackling\n",
      "tangible real-world problems\n",
      "faced by everyone. I loved that we had billboard ads in train stations and we got to speak to our end-users every day. One of my proudest moments: at an Amazon pitch event to people in tech, we were voted the ‘startup most likely to grow exponentially’.\n",
      "And then, our path to exponential growth was accelerated suddenly and wonderfully. Our top client, recruitment powerhouse GQR, was interested in a deeper partnership. In 2021 untapt was\n",

For the unwashed masses trying to build a business, it's important to remember many \"releases\" are simply repackaged PhD theses.   #openai #llms #genai #gpt4\n",

      "CEO Alexandr Wang made waves with his announcement a couple of weeks ago about adopting an #MEI approach at Scale AI. Whether or not you agree with him on this, what rings clear is an unflinching commitment to hiring the best talent possible and some of the strategies used to accomplish this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I use him as an example because even though I am a recruiting and hiring expert, I learn a lot from those out in the trenches building their companies and he has obviously done so with great success! \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the strategies mentioned by Alexandr is \"casting a wide net\" in recruiting. I have become a firm believer in this strategy and it is one that we employ on behalf of clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are just some of the reasons to cast a wide net in hiring:\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ Casting a wide net is more likely to attract candidates with diverse thinking styles, problem-solving approaches, and experiences. This type of cognitive and experiential diversity can lead to increased innovation and creativity and can help your organization be more resilient to future changes in the industry or economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ A wider search can uncover candidates with unique skill combinations or non-traditional backgrounds who might be overlooked in a narrow search. These \"hidden gems\" can bring fresh perspectives and innovative solutions to your organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ A larger candidate pool increases the chances of finding individuals who are not just qualified, but are an excellent fit for both the role and the company culture. This can lead to better performance and reduced turnover.\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ Engaging with a wider range of candidates increases your company's visibility in the job market and naturally expands your company's network. This can also lead to valuable market insights, potential partnerships, or customer connections that extend beyond the hiring process itself. Even candidates who aren't hired can become brand ambassadors if they have a positive experience, potentially leading to future hires. \n",
      "\n",
      "These are many of the reasons we cast a wide net on behalf of clients. Mainly we want them to have the assurance that they are hiring the best candidate possible and not having to settle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with all the benefits, I recognize that casting a wide net makes recruiting more labor intensive and time consuming. It also requires a more systematic approach to candidate management and may require advanced skills in assessing candidate fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether for an executive or mid-level hire, we can handle the tedious, time consuming aspects.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to our full service model, we offer alternative solutions for non-executive level recruiting and hiring. I'd be glad to hear your needs and discuss ways that we can be of support. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm also always willing to offer advice or ideas that you can employ on your own. A rising tide lifts all boats.\n",

Using LLMs is an inexact science, but has its own needs in processes and tools. While most of the attention has been on the LLMS, their capabilities, and RAG, there are mundane issues that need to be taken care of, issues where the solutions for pre-LLM development are not that well-suited. These include version management, integration, testing, data management, quality assessment, and more. This article covers many of those practical aspects. \n",

      "inception llms: experimenting with a new LLM design pattern where I prompt Gemini to write code on my behalf which, in turn,  uses Gemini to perform tasks - So meta, isn't it? One prompt for one task. in less than two hours created a full pipeline which would have taken days otherwise. Gemini wrote more than 97% of my code, discoverying libraries I was not aware of - overall, saving me tons of time as swe. Where do you think you can use this power in your product? try it yourself next time you develop a feature. I named it \"inception llms\"\n",

      "Something that we contend with in my work, as the major models have become commoditized, is the decision becoming less about benchmark performance and more about the cost/value equation or the nuance of usage patterns favoring different \"category leader\" capabilities. Or sometimes just platform vs. best-of-breed.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the commercial models all qualifying as \"usually quite good,\" and the open source models closing the gap (something I'm super nerded out about,) I'm curious how you make decisions for yourselves or your clients about the right tool for the job (something, something hammer and nails...)\n",

      "He shared an interesting insight which is that agentic capabilities might be more of an alignment problem rather than a foundational capability issue. Similar to the difference between GPT-3 and InstructGPT, some open-source foundation models are simply trained to 'answer everything in one response regardless of the complexity of the question' - after all, that's the user preference in chatbot use cases. Just a bit of post-training on agentic trajectories can make an immediate and dramatic difference.\n",

      "5 New implementations of Diffusion Models\n",
      "Diffusion models are widely used for image and video generation but remain underexplored in text generation, where autoregressive models (ARMs) dominate. Unlike ARMs, which produce tokens sequentially, diffusion models iteratively refine noise through denoising steps, offering greater flexibility and speed.\n",
      "Recent advancements show a shift toward using diffusion models in place of, or alongside, ARMs. Researchers also combine strengths from both methods and integrate autoregressive concepts into diffusion.\n",
      "Here are 5 new implementations of diffusion models:\n",
      "1. Mercury family of diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) by Inception Labs ->\n",
      "https://www.inceptionlabs.ai/news\n",
      "It applies diffusion to text and code data, enabling sequence generation 10x faster than today's top LLMs. Now available Mercury Coder can run at over 1,000 tokens/sec on NVIDIA H100s.\n",
      "2. Diffusion of Thoughts (DoT) ->\n",
      "Diffusion of Thoughts: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Diffusion Language\n",
      "  Models (2402.07754)\n",
      "Integrates diffusion models with Chain-of-Thought. DoT allows reasoning steps to diffuse gradually over time. This flexibility enables balancing between reasoning quality and computational cost.\n",
      "3. LLaDA ->\n",
      "Large Language Diffusion Models (2502.09992)\n",
      "Shows diffusion models' potential in replacing ARMs. Trained with pre-training and SFT, LLaDA masks tokens, predicts them via a Transformer, and optimizes a likelihood bound. LLaDA matches key LLM skills, and surpasses GPT-4o in reversal poetry.\n",
      "4. LanDiff ->\n",
      "The Best of Both Worlds: Integrating Language Models and Diffusion\n",
      "  Models for Video Generation (2503.04606)\n",
      "This hybrid text-to-video model combines autoregressive and diffusion paradigms, introducing a semantic tokenizer, an LM for token generation, and a streaming diffusion model. LanDiff outperforms models like Sora.\n",
      "5. General Interpolating Discrete Diffusion (GIDD) ->\n",
      "Generalized Interpolating Discrete Diffusion (2503.04482)\n",
      "A flexible noising process with a novel diffusion ELBO enables combining masking and uniform noise, allowing diffusion models to correct mistakes, where ARMs struggle.\n",
